# Book-Scraper-and-Analysis

I built a Python-based scraper to collect book data (title, price, rating, availability) from Books to Scrape across multiple pages. Then, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the data to uncover interesting insights. I also added a simple prediction model to demonstrate machine learning with real data!

ðŸ”§ Technologies used:

Python (requests, parsel)

pandas & matplotlib for data analysis and visualization

scikit-learn for basic prediction

Jupyter Notebook for the full workflow
